# SpyPartyParse

## About

This repo is a collection of utilities for parsing various SpyParty files.  Right now there is only a parser for the headers of replay files.  The parser is incomplete as it will not parse older replay files successfully as the format has changed.  There are also some level IDs that are missing from the table in the parser.  Contributions on both fronts are welcome. 

## TODO

1. Clean up parser offset objects a little bit
